summary: Quick and dirty terminal function for using Talon's mimic( )
---

Talon Voice has an inbuilt `mimic` function that lets the user test commands. This is a feature I use fairly regularly when I'm in a space with too much background talking, or I just want to test something.

This code snippet creates two functions `m` and `M` (short for `mimic`).

```bash
function m() {
  command=""
  for word in "$@"; do
    if [[ "$word" == *, || "$word" == *. ]]; then
      word=$(echo "${word}" | tr -d ',.')
      command="$command $word"
      command="${command#"${command%%[![:space:]]*}"}"
      command="${command%"${command##*[![:space:]]}"}"
      echo "mimic(\"${command}\")"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
      echo "actions.sleep(.05)"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
      command="" 
    else
      command="$command $word"
    fi
  done
  echo "mimic(\"${command/ /}\")"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
}

function M() {
  echo "mimic(\"command tab\")"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
  echo "actions.sleep(.05)"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
  m "$@"
  echo "actions.sleep(.05)"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
  echo "mimic(\"command tab\")"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
}
```

In order to work, `$TALON_REPL_PATH` needs to be defined earlier else in your `.bashrc`

## What does m do?

`m` is a function that pipes a sentence into mimic, splitting commands on period `.` and comma `,`. It does this via looping over the stored arguments in `$@`, which will be every space separated word in the entered line.

The command `m focus chrome, go tab one` will split into the follow parts:
 - `m`: The function being executed
 - `focus chrome,`: The first phrase being examined by the script
 - `go tab one`: The second phrase being examined by the script

In the above example, `focus chrome,` has a trailing comma, this is used to separate commands. `focus chrome,` will be split into `focus chrome` and a short sleep. The mimic command only accepts strings of words Talon Voice understands, so for example mimic will fail with numbers e.g. `1` but would accept strings representing numbers e.g. `one`. Additional characters like punctuation tend to also break `mimic`, so when using this script I don't use them.

```bash
function m() {
  # begin an empty command
  command=""
  # loop over all arguments passed to the function
  for word in "$@"; do
    # If , or . are found in an argument
    if [[ "$word" == *, || "$word" == *. ]]; then
      # remove , or . from the argument
      word=$(echo "${word}" | tr -d ',.')
      # add the current argument to the command
      command="$command $word"
      # Remove leading whitespace
      command="${command#"${command%%[![:space:]]*}"}"
      # Remove trailing whitespace
      command="${command%"${command##*[![:space:]]}"}"
      # Pipe the command to the talon repl running mimic
      echo "mimic(\"${command}\")"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
      # Pipe a short sleep between each command
      echo "actions.sleep(.05)"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
      command="" 
    # if no , or . are found in the argument
    # append the argument to the command
    else
      command="$command $word"
    fi
  done
  # Run the last saved command
  echo "mimic(\"${command/ /}\")"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
}
``` 

### What's with the > /dev/null

This just mutes return statements from the repl so that noise won't pollute the terminal as I'm working.

## What does M do

`M` is a helper function that automatically returns to the last used window. This makes it easy to run a short command e.g. `tab search, word github, south, lap`. In my repo that would execute in order:
 - `command tab` to switch windows. Chrome is the assumed window in this case
 - `tab search` to run the command to search open tabs
 - `word github` to type github into the search
 - `south` to press the down arrow
 - `lap` to press enter, and now we'd on a github tab

```bash
function M() {
  # Change to the last used window
  echo "mimic(\"command tab\")"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
  # Send a short sleep
  echo "actions.sleep(.05)"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
  # Run commands after `M`
  m "$@"
  # Send a short sleep
  echo "actions.sleep(.05)"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
  # Restore back the original used window
  # (as long as no other window changing commands are used)
  echo "mimic(\"command tab\")"| $TALON_REPL_PATH > /dev/null
}
```

 (Note: it's hard coded for mac at the moment but mimicking `command tab` so if that doesn't switch to your last window in your OS it will need updating).

## When is this actually a terrible choice to test something

Funnily enough, I had thought that using `mimic` to test if pieces of my Talon setup were functioning properly was totally fine. Turns out no, `mimic` is not the same as actually saying a whole phrase in Talon. This is important when testing commands from other sources like `talon_gaze_ocr`, which depends on a phrase being said to generate timestamp data. `mimic` does not generate that data.
